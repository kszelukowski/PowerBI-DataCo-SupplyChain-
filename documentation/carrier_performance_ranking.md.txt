# 🚛 Carrier Performance & SLA Ranking

This example demonstrates how to use the measures in this repo to create a **Carrier Scorecard**.

## The Goal
Rank shipping providers based on a composite score of speed and reliability.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. The Calculation
We combine `[On-Time Delivery %]` and `[Average Delivery Delay]` into a weighted score:
```dax
Carrier Score = 
([On-Time Delivery %] * 0.7) + 
(DIVIDE(1, [Average Delivery Delay] + 1) * 0.3)
